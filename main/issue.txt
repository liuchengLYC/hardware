1. What is the following array in LedDriver.cpp? Please remove it if it is not necessary.
const static color_t blank[127] = {{
    .green = 0,
    .red = 0,
    .blue = 0,
}};
##blank is used to clear frame, required when calling LedDriver::clear_frame

2. Please do not initialize the members in the class definition, the initialization should be done in the constructor if the init is essential!
##if it's value such as -1 to avoid call before corect initialize, do we have to edit it?

3. Please add #ifdef FILE_NAME_H and #endif at the top and the bottom of all the header files to avoid multiple include leaded error.
##done

4. Please separate move the function implementation outside the class definition.
##done

5. Please add some comments to explain some of the variables and macros. For example:
in pca9955.h
#define IREFALL 0x45
#define MAXIMUM_BRIGHTNESS 63

6. Please use macro to express some numerics. For example, in LedDriver.hpp:
ChannelHandle channel_handle[50];
You should replace it to

#define MAX_NUM_CH 50
ChannelHandle channel_handle[50];

##it's there any other needed to change?
7. Please take the advantage of enumeration. For example, there should be a enumeration for led type like:
enum LED_TYPE_t
{
    LED_TYPE_STRIP,
    LED_TYPE_OF,
};
then, the determination for the led type can be expressed like this:

if(config.type == LED_TYPE_STRIP) {
        rmt_activate = true;
        new_ws2812b_channel(config.gpio_or_addr, &channel);
        new_ws2812b_encoder(&encoder);
}
which avoids the implicit expression of a number 1.
also, the definition of led_config_t will become

struct led_config_t {
    LED_TYPE_t type : 1;
    uint8_t led_count : 7;
    uint8_t gpio_or_addr;
    uint8_t pca_channel;
};
##type is now using
